Java code that writes and reads in a basic way to/from HBase. Related environment scripts. Node.js project that similarly operates HBase, has some API-server code included (including curl command to connect to it), and has SSL configured for it, and the certificate and key generation scripts. Works with the 'HBase' VirtualBox, best used as a share folder on the VirtualBox, such that the various scripts can directly be used. The code tested to run on Ubuntu.
